Developed an optimal positioning strategy for deploying active decoys to enhance missile defense in high-stakes scenarios. This project focused on the effectiveness of soft kill options, which offer cost-efficient and strategic advantages over hard kill options. Conducted extensive computer simulations to assess radar and jammer parameters, demonstrating that precise decoy deployment can achieve missile miss distances of over 0.5 kilometers against monopulse radar-guided threats. By analyzing various parametric scenarios, identified the ideal angular position (around 110 degrees from the reference axis) for maximizing decoy effectiveness. This approach enables improved protection of valuable assets, such as naval ships and land installations, from single or multiple missile threats in terminal guidance phases, with a high success rate in diverting attacks.
